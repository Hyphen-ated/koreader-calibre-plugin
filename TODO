# TODO
- [x] Add an `.editorconfig` and `.pylintrc` to define code layout
- [ ] Add support for highlights and bookmarks into a metadata field
- [ ] Make the warning about synced metadata more informative
- [ ] Fix VSCodium's `debugpy`, maybe using [this hack](https://github.com/whacked/calibre-viewer-annotation#alternative-installation)?
- [ ] Fix all pylint errors and warnings
- [ ] Add `last_page` for PDFs instead of `last_xpointer`
- [ ] Add support for highlights and bookmarks into the `annotations` table in calibre's `metadata.db`
- [ ] USBMS devices have `calibre.devices.usbms.cli.CLI.list()`. Use that to find sidecars (and their mtime?), instead of trying paths that might not exist? (Note that `calibre.devices.smart_device_app.driver.SMART_DEVICE_APP` does not have a `list` function.)
- [ ] Sync from calibre to KOReader?
